# DSRemote-macOS

DSRemote ported to work with Rigol DHO800 and DHO900 series. Currently at experimental stage.

This is a quick and dirty patched version of [DSRemote](https://teuniz.net/DSRemote/) to allow building on macOS without USB support.

## Compiling on macOS without USB support

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

brew install make git qt@5

brew link qt@5

git clone <https://github.com/snarkyerica/DSRemote-macOS.git>

cd DSRemote-macOS

qmake

make -j8 (replace 8 with the number of threads you'd like to use)

Copy the resulting .app file into your Applications folder, right click and Open.



Original README follows.



# DSRemote

Operate your Rigol oscilloscope from your Linux desktop
========================================================

Compiling and installing on Ubuntu Linux and derivatives
---------------------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make git qtbase5-dev-tools qtbase5-dev qt5-default
git clone <https://gitlab.com/Teuniz/DSRemote.git>
cd DSRemote
qmake
make -j4
sudo make install
dsremote

For USB connection setup use the following commands
----------------------------------------------------

sudo groupadd usbtmc
sudo usermod -a -G usbtmc <username>
reboot

Now you can run the program by typing: dsremote

(USB connection does not work on modern USB host controllers thanks to
a bug in the scopes' firmware that Rigol does not want to fix.)

 Read also the file readme_usbtcm_driver.txt
 and the file notes.txt.

Supported devices
---------------

DS6000 and DS1000Z series oscilloscopes.

### MSO4000/DS4000 series

There is some basic support like capturing screenshots.

Not tested yet:

* Record & Playback function
* Wave Inspector
* serial decoding.
